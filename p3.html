have been widely
adopted.</td>

potential to disrupt
multiple domains
</td>

have been adopted
infrequently by a
few enterprises and
sill need to be
refined .</td>

have been adopted
universally , they
brought about the last
wave of disruption.</td>

have much standalone
impact but add value
when combined with
higher-order use cases.</td>

invest in developing and
scaling these use cases.</td>

investigate their
relevance and
usability.</td>

need to invest in
developing them ,
they simply need to
use them 
.</td>

leverage these use cases
to build complex Al
solution.</td>
